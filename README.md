Problem Statement/ Motivation:
Nowadys, people like to communicate more on social media than in person. The pattern of the behaviour of a person's tweets, comments, posts etc. tells a lot about their psychology.
Solution: 
Machine Learning has the ability to observe the pattern and accordingly depict. This project streams tweets using Twitter's API(accessible only with a private key for developer's account), collects, processes them and calculates polarity on the basis of a dictionary of preloaded values.
